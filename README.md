# LegacyVEX
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system
This is a To-Be-Added (TBA) repository for the Legacy VEX equipment I use for my personal projects. If my code helps you with your task, feel free to use it -- if you use any large portion of my code, please send me a link to your code and credit me in your commented out section, thank you.

If you are a VEX programmer, and you'd like to assist me or point out any flaws or errors, please don't hesitate to create an Issue! I'm open to added contributers if you would like to be one.
