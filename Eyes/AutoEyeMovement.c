/*************************************************************************
Animatronic Head with Moving Eyes
Sam Rice - 20210320
https://github.com/RoboticRice/LegacyVEX/

Description: This program is under development. It is intended to control
the Eye movement of an animatronic.

Additional Notes:
* The "bVexAutonomousMode = false;" is needed to open up communication so
  that the VEX can talk to the radio transmitter. We aren't driving this
  model via remote, so I have set this to "true"
* Need to add Eye Lids movement at a later date.
